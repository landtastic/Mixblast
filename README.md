# This is a minimal music video player.

It uses the Youtube, Last.fm, and Echo Nest APIs.  

It tries its best but doesn't always get everything right.  

Playlists are saved automatically under Recent Playlists.  

You can also save your mix to a Youtube playlist.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Spacebar = Play/Pause, Left Arrow = Back, Right Arrow = Next, ~ = Open/Close Text List Editor  

iPhone users: works best in Dolphin browser. To play in background: lock phone, swipe up, click play in lock screen controls.  

Welp, see ya later.
